              For over 20 years, CAN has supported individuals with vision loss by offering programs 
              such as household care assistance, inclusive social events, and application guidance for 
              essential services. These initiatives are driven by our belief that everyone deserves to 
              live a full and independent life, regardless of their challenges.

              By collaborating with volunteers, partners, and the broader community, we continue to 
              expand our reach and impact. Our journey began with a simple recognition: that individuals 
              who are deaf, hard-of-hearing, or DeafBlind deserve comprehensive support services that 
              address their unique needs and promote independence.

            <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600 mb-6">
              Over the years, we have grown from a small grassroots organization to a respected provider 
              of auxiliary support services. We have built strong partnerships with statewide agencies, 
              developed innovative programs, and created a community where individuals feel valued, 
              supported, and empowered to achieve their goals.

              As we look toward the future, CAN remains committed to our founding principles while 
              continuously evolving to meet the changing needs of our community. Our 20th anniversary 
              celebration in September 2025 will mark not just our past achievements, but our ongoing 
              commitment to empowering lives through connection and support.
